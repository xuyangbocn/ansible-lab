Ansible Role for C2S for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

Profile Description:  
This profile demonstrates compliance against the  
U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.  
  
This baseline was inspired by the Center for Internet Security  
(CIS) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Benchmark, v2.1.1 - 01-31-2017.  
  
For the SCAP Security Guide project to remain in compliance with  
CIS' terms and conditions, specifically Restrictions(8), note  
there is no representation or claim that the C2S profile will  
ensure a system is in compliance or consistency with the CIS  
baseline.

The tasks that are used in this role are generated using OpenSCAP.
See the OpenSCAP project for more details on Ansible playbook generation at [https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap)
